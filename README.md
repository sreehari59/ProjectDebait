# Project Debait

Two agents debate a topic, e.g. "cats vs. dogs". Each agent represents a side and they go back and forth. After a short discussion the debate ends and a third agent (judge) decides who won.

As a stretch goal a forth agent (coach) optimizes the losing agents prompt and the debate repeats. Based on the outcome or score, the system improves via some kind of reinforcement learning.
